    "# Project Scope\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Vision\n",
    "* I commit to a project from start-to-finish\n",
    "* I build a Deep Learning model that summarizes text\n",
    "* __STRETCH GOAL:__ Simple website demo\n",
    "\n",
    "## Project Description\n",
    "### Problem\n",
    "* I can't seem to finish a project due to lack of pre-production planning and motivation\n",
    "* I have a hard time understanding PyTorch and Deep Learning\n",
    "### Target Audience\n",
    "* Anyone that finds this open sourced code helpful\n",
    "* Myself\n",
    "### Needs\n",
    "* I need a project to add to my portfolio\n",
    "* I need to gain a better understanding of PyTorch and Deep Learning\n",
    "\n",
    "## Goals and My Approach\n",
    "### Goals\n",
    "* Go through the entire process of the project cycle\n",
    "* Understand all the code\n",
    "** why does this do that?\n",
    "** what does it do?\n",
    "### My Approach\n",
    "* I will use a transformer to create the model - inspiration from Dr. Michael Campbell\n",
    "* I will evaluate different outcomes by adjusting hyperparameters\n",
    "* Regarding the website stretch goal, I will make that in plain HTML, CSS and JS with a flask server as the backend\n",
    "## Project Acceptance\n",
    "* Some form of transformer is created and utilized to summarize a short sentance\n",
    "* A project reflection is required and I will make sure I reflect on the entire process as well as talk about my thoughts\n",
